        "### Timing\n",
        "\n",
        "We can use the `ExecuteTime` plugin to time the execution of each code cell in Jupyter notebooks.\n",
        "Use the following commands to install the plugin:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions\n",
        "jupyter contrib nbextension install --user\n",
